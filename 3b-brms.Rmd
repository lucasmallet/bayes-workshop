# What is brms?

--

+ Developed by [Paul-Christian BÃ¼rkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/).  
--

+ In brief, `brms` allows fitting GLMMs (but not only) in a `lme4`-like syntax within the Bayesian framework and MCMC methods with Stan.

--

+ I'm not a Stan user, but it doesn't matter. 

--

+ The [vignettes](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/) are great to get you started. I also recommend the [list of blog posts about `brms`](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/blog/brms-blogposts/).

--

+ Nice alternative to `NIMBLE` if you do not need to code your models.

# Example

Say we capture, mark and release $n = 57$ animals at the beginning of a winter, out of which we recapture $y = 19$ animals alive:
```{r}
y <- 19 # nb of success
n <- 57 # nb of attempts
dat <- data.frame(alive = 19, total = 57)
dat
```

Assuming all animals are independent of each other and have the same survival probability $\theta$, then $y$ the number of alive animals at the end of the winter is binomial. Using a uniform prior for survival, we have:

\begin{align*}
   y &\sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta) &\text{[likelihood]}
   \\
  \theta &\sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1) &\text{[prior for }\theta \text{]} \\
\end{align*}

We'd like to estimate winter survival $\theta$. An obvious estimate of the probability of a binomial is the proportion of cases, $19/57 = 0.3333333$.

# Maximum-likelihood estimation

To get an estimate of survival, we fit a logistic regression using the `glm()` function. The data are grouped (or aggregated), so we need to specify the number of alive and dead individuals as a two-column matrix on the left hand side of the model formula:
```{r}
mle <- glm(cbind(alive, total - alive) ~ 1, 
           family = binomial("logit"), # family = binomial("identity") would be more straightforward
           data = dat)
```

---
# Maximum-likelihood estimation

On the logit scale, survival is estimated at:
```{r}
coef(mle) # logit scale
```

---
# Maximum-likelihood estimation

After back-transformation using the reciprocal logit, we obtain:
```{r}
plogis(coef(mle))
```

# Bayesian analysis with `NIMBLE`

+ See previous section.

# Bayesian analysis with `brms`

In `brms`, you write:
```{r}
bayes.brms <- brm(alive | trials(total) ~ 1, 
                  family = binomial("logit"), # binomial("identity") would be more straightforward
                  data = dat,
                  chains = 2, # nb of chains
                  iter = 5000, # nb of iterations, including burnin
                  warmup = 1000, # burnin
                  thin = 1) # thinning
```

---
# Display results

You can display the results:
```{r}
bayes.brms
```

---
# Visualize results

And visualize the posterior density and trace of survival (on the logit scale):
```{r}
plot(bayes.brms)
```

---
# Visualize results

To get survival on the $[0,1]$ scale, we extract the MCMC values, then apply the reciprocal logit function to each of these values, and summarize its posterior distribution: 
```{r}
draws_fit <- as_draws_matrix(bayes.brms)
draws_fit
summarize_draws(plogis(draws_fit[,1]))
```

---
# Priors

What is the prior used by default? 
```{r}
prior_summary(bayes.brms)
```

---
# Priors

What if I want to use the same prior as in `NIMBLE` instead? 
```{r}
nlprior <- prior(normal(0, 1.5), class = "Intercept") # new prior
bayes.brms <- brm(alive | trials(total) ~ 1, 
                  family = binomial("logit"), 
                  data = dat, 
                  prior = nlprior, # set prior by hand
                  chains = 2, # nb of chains
                  iter = 5000, # nb of iterations, including burnin
                  warmup = 1000, # burnin
                  thin = 1)
```

---
# Priors

Double-check the prior that was used:
```{r}
prior_summary(bayes.brms)
```
